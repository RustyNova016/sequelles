# Sequelles

An oppinionated library to deal with SQLx data. 

⚠️ This is **NOT** an ORM. It doesn't generate any SQL queries. Only link to ones ⚠️

This library heavily rely on using row ids (`UNIQUE AUTOINCREMENT` integers that are above 0) to join data together. So if you already use those, this might be the library for you!
